# Product Listing API

This is the backend service for the Product Listing Application.
It provides product data via a RESTful API, dynamically calculates product prices based on real-time gold prices, and supports filtering by price range and popularity.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Mock Products API: Products are served from a static JSON file.
- Dynamic Price Calculation:
  
  ```ini
  Price = (popularityScore + 1) * weight * goldPrice
  ```
  - weight = product weight (grams)
  - popularityScore = product popularity (0‚Äì1)
  - goldPrice = real-time gold price per gram (fetched from GoldAPI.io)

- Gold Price Caching: Gold price is cached for 10 minutes to reduce API calls.
- Filtering Support:
  - Price range (minPrice, maxPrice)
  - Popularity range (minPopularity, maxPopularity)
